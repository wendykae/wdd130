       <P>I am married and have 6 kids and we live in Austin Tx.  We love it here. Its a great place to live.
          I am orginally from Clinon Utah. After we married we moved to Utah county whrere we lived for 12 years before we moved here to Texas. I love reading and studing and going on road trips in our motorhome. This is a picture of my husband and I at baseball gaem at the rangers stadiumn. My husband is a yankees fan and the rangers were plahing them so we got tickets and went. This was my first professional baseball game. </P>

         <p> "Texas is proud state and they love to show it. They have Texas everything. It's located at the bottom of the United States. Its hot and mildly humid. Its such a big state that some here want Texas to  become its own country. It's a great place to live and raise and God fearing family. </p>
